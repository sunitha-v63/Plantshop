                    plants.Good indoor plants will tolerate lower light and humidity. Also, they will be less likely
                    to deal with pests. Plus, they usually do not grow too much (you wouldn't want an indoor
                    plant to grow at a rapid rate). The best indoor plants include the followingAll plants can act
                    as air purifiers but these plants are more beneficial than others.Succulents and cacti need
                    continuous, daily sunlight. Plants with foliage need roughly 8 hours of light per day. The
                    amount of light depends on the plants you are growing, so we suggest doing research on
                    the specific plants you are growing

                <li>A good root system - This is incredibly important when choosing a plant. It's not
                    practical to pull a plant out of its pot to check its roots but if it is a small plants this can
                    be done. Healthy roots are thick and light in color</li>
                <li>Foliage- Here's a good rule of thumb when it comes to plant foliage: if you can't see
                    through it, the foliage is thick enough</li>
                <li>Check for disease - Some signs of a plant with pests or disease are: white dots, sticky
                    residue on the leaves and a bad odor.</li>
